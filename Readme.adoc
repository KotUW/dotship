= DotShip!

It's a simple but effective dotfile manager. This project is my first time trying zig.
So don't judge ЁЯШЛ.

== Problems?!

* What if the file name contains `@` or `=` chars. Which are right now not supported.

== What?

It stores your dotfiles in `folder1.folder2.filename.ext` format where the root is `~` of the user.
So above will be converted `/home/<user>/folder1/folder2/filename.ext`.

Note: If going for hidden dir is the destination (i.e. `.config/...`) you can write (`=config/...`) so that they are non-hidden

=== Cli Refrences

* [x] `sync` тоз
    Defaults, parses the config dir (Created if didn't exist) and scans the directory for files and sym links them.
* [x] `help` тоз
    Usage info!
* [-] `Add/Remove` тоз
    Provides an Interface to add files given a path. It copies it into the format into the config directory and deletes from the source. and then maybe symlinks.
* [ ] `Push/Git` тоз
    Git pushes changes to the repo. Automatically toggled with sync.
